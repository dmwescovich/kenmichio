      <h1>Kenmichio Goes Female</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">A Digital Edition of a Found Manuscript</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
<i>Kenmichio Goes Female</i> is a weird book. It is a manually typed manuscript of a novel written by an unknown and unpublished lawyer and salesman from St. Louis, Missouri, in 1934. It doesn&rsquo;t have any particular reason to be important. It isn&rsquo;t a long-lost Hemingway novel. It has no historical utility, that is, it hasn&rsquo;t accomplished historical things in the way that perhaps Shakespeare has, or the <i>Declaration of Independence</i>. It&rsquo;s writer was neither a giant of industry or of the academy, nor an explorer or a president. So, after making the choice to ignore the shallow voice in my head inisting that I should be working on something &ldquo;big,&rdquo; Shakespeare or facism or cultural Marxism, I entered Kenmichio and found a fascinating story about particularly American questions on the nature of power, gender, and change, the tension between the public and the private selves, and, simply, good manners.
</p>

<p>
Fifteen years ago, my uncle asked if I would like to see the manuscript of a novel written by his uncle in the 1930s. Of course, I was interested. So, my uncle produced, from a crumbling cardboard box, a 750-page novel, hand-typed in 1934; <i>Kenmichio Goes Female</i>, written by Eugene Eddy, my grandfather&rsquo;s oldest brother. For the next hour or so, I read the first ten or twelve chapters of this astonishing artifact, and I discovered the story of a fictional state of the United States (the great state of Kenmichio) that had, shortly after the adoption of the 19th Amendment, elected all female leaders and respresentatives to the state goverment. Kenmichio is a state that had indeed &ldquo;gone female.&rdquo; On one hand, I found Kenmichio to be an interesting thought experiment focused on the question of how exactly women&rsquo;s suffrage might change the status quo of American electoral politics. On the other, it was concerned with larger ideas about power, leadership, legislation, and gender. In a broad sweep, Kenmichio asks a precise question: What would a state of the union led by all female leaders be like at a practical, functional level? Kenmichio does not ignore questions of gender and culture, but at first glance it tends to be preoccupied with the procedural and legislative aspects of women&rsquo;s suffrage, and its influence on the American political system. Yet, Kenmichio, at that first reading, struck me as a weird novel mostly for its rather dated language and its naive assumptions about gender, politics, and power. I thought perhaps the language and assumptions, at best, might only make sense in the historical context of the Depression Era United States, less than 25 years after the voting rights of women had been made the law; however, it bristled against my modern sensibilities of these ideas as being hopelessly misguided, if not largely offensive.
</p>

<p>
After reading those first few pages, I placed the manuscript back into the box in which my uncle had been keeping it for the last 40 years, replaced the box on the shelf in my uncle&rsquo;s basement, and thought of it only occasionally over the next decade. I knew that Kenmichio was there and it was a curious tale I might tell now and then, but I didn&rsquo;t have any idea what it meant to me (if anything at all), or what I might be able to do with it. This first encounter with Kenmichio was during the Spring of 2004, I think.
</p>

<p>
Fast-forward to spring 2017. I was taking a course called &ldquo;Literature and Technology,&rdquo; which concerned itself generally with the academic field of the Digital Humanities, but more specifically with questions regarding the technical tools available for the processing and manipulation of digital texts. During this course, <i>Kenmichio</i> kept coming back to my mind. I knew that there was this substantial manuscript in my uncle&rsquo;s possession, but what might I be able to do with this artifact? My experience with digital imaging indicated that I could create a digital facsimile, producing a permanent copy of the original manuscript toward preservation of a physical document that was already over 80 years old. Further, encouraged by John Bryant&rsquo;s concept of the fluid text, &ldquo;any written work that exists in multiple material versions due to revisions (authorial, editorial, cultural) upon which we may construct an interpretation&rdquo; (Bryant 17), I began to visualize a readable digital text accounting for the many hand-written annotations Eddy included in the manuscript itself. These emendations are various, and range from simple spelling corrections, or the occationally added quotation mark forgotten in the typing, to much more substantial edits where the author might cross out large blocks of text to be removed or placed in other locations in the text. Sometimes, Eddy even makes wry remarks to himself regarding the text, at one part noting, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited. This is the first two sections. Still working on the last part.&rdquo; (<b>CITATION LINK</b>) So, embedded in the manuscript itself were at least two layers of text: the typed text of the novel proper and the handwritten annotations the author left for himself, or the text of the author trying to tell a story and his textual voice talking about the process of telling the story.
</p>
<p>
By the time I had acquired the manuscript of <i>Kenmichio</i> from my uncle, and had the chance to read the first half of the novel, I found that I had begun to compile a set of annotations of my own. Initially, I made notes on the nature and condition of the physical artifact; eventually, my notes turned to questions raised by the text and the mansucript, by the peculiarities of the language present in the novel, and by <i>Kenmichio</i>&rsquo;s relationship to other expressions of feminist utopia in literature. Finally, it became clear that the overall structure of this project would be a digital edition of <i>Kenmichio</i> that would include a digital facsimile (annotated to orient the reader to the manuscript as a physical object), a readable digital text taking into account all of the handwritten edits included by the author (also annotated in order to orient the reader to the nature of the novel&rsquo;s content and composition), as well as a literary introduction situating the novel within the context of feminist utopian literature. These initial ideas would eventually serve to influence the editorial rationale for this project, as well as the overall design of the website where it is housed. This website is the culmination of this trajectory, and these paragraphs sketch broadly where this novel came from, how I came to possess it, and what I would eventually do with it.
</p>
<p>
One question, however, I had not initially considered addressing with any detail was that of the author himself, Eugene Eddy. Even though Eddy is a relation, my great-uncle, and my possession of his manuscript is arguably in large part a result of this relationship, he was dead long before I came around. In fact, those members of my family who might have had the opportunity to know him didn&rsquo;t, and their memories of who he was vary greatly and are tinged by obscurity and legend.

        <h2>Editorial Rationale</h2>
        <p>The digitization of Eugene Eddy's unpublished manuscript serves three foundational purposes: a) the preservation and digital presentation of the physical manuscript itself, b) the creation of a readable digital plain-text edition, and c) hosting a respository of critical texts which consider not only the analysis and interpretation of the text as an aesthetic work of fiction, but also the various questions that arise through the process of textual digitization.</p>
        <p>Digital preservation of the manuscript was accomplished largely through high-quality image scans of each page of the manuscript which were saved as master files, and later processed for web optimization (courtesy of the <a href="https://iris.siue.edu/">IRIS Center</a> at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, who granted access to the scanning equipment and image processsing software).</p>
