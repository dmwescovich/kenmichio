      <h1>Kenmichio Goes Female</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">A Digital Edition of a Found Manuscript</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
<i>Kenmichio Goes Female</i> is a weird book. It is a manually typed manuscript of a novel written by an unknown and unpublished lawyer and salesman from St. Louis, Missouri, in 1934. It doesn&rsquo;t have any particular reason to be important. It isn&rsquo;t a long-lost Hemingway novel. It has no historical utility, that is, it hasn&rsquo;t accomplished historical things in the way that perhaps Shakespeare has, or the <i>Declaration of Independence</i>. It&rsquo;s writer was neither a giant of industry or of the academy, nor an explorer or a president. So, after making the choice to ignore the shallow voice in my head inisting that I should be working on something &ldquo;big,&rdquo; Shakespeare or facism or cultural Marxism, I entered Kenmichio and found a fascinating story about particularly American questions on the nature of power, gender, and change, the tension between the public and the private selves, and, simply, good manners.
</p>

<p>
Fifteen years ago, my uncle asked if I would like to see the manuscript of a novel written by his uncle in the 1930s. Of course, I was interested. So, my uncle produced, from a crumbling cardboard box, a 750-page novel, hand-typed in 1934; <i>Kenmichio Goes Female</i>, written by Eugene Eddy, my grandfather&rsquo;s oldest brother. For the next hour or so, I read the first ten or twelve chapters of this astonishing artifact, and I discovered the story of a fictional state of the United States (the great state of Kenmichio) that had, shortly after the adoption of the 19th Amendment, elected all female leaders and respresentatives to the state goverment. Kenmichio is a state that had indeed &ldquo;gone female.&rdquo; On one hand, I found Kenmichio to be an interesting thought experiment focused on the question of how exactly women&rsquo;s suffrage might change the status quo of American electoral politics. On the other, it was concerned with larger ideas about power, leadership, legislation, and gender. In a broad sweep, Kenmichio asks a precise question: What would a state of the union led by all female leaders be like at a practical, functional level? Kenmichio does not ignore questions of gender and culture, but at first glance it tends to be preoccupied with the procedural and legislative aspects of women&rsquo;s suffrage, and its influence on the American political system. Yet, Kenmichio, at that first reading, struck me as a weird novel mostly for its rather dated language and its naive assumptions about gender, politics, and power. I thought perhaps the language and assumptions, at best, might only make sense in the historical context of the Depression Era United States, less than 25 years after the voting rights of women had been made the law; however, it bristled against my modern sensibilities of these ideas as being hopelessly misguided, if not largely offensive.
</p>

<p>
After reading those first few pages, I placed the manuscript back into the box in which my uncle had been keeping it for the last 40 years, replaced the box on the shelf in my uncle&rsquo;s basement, and thought of it only occasionally over the next decade. I knew that Kenmichio was there and it was a curious tale I might tell now and then, but I didn&rsquo;t have any idea what it meant to me (if anything at all), or what I might be able to do with it. This first encounter with Kenmichio was during the Spring of 2004, I think.
</p>

<p>
Fast-forward to spring 2017. I was taking a course called &ldquo;Literature and Technology,&rdquo; which concerned itself generally with the academic field of the Digital Humanities, but more specifically with questions regarding the technical tools available for the processing and manipulation of digital texts. During this course, <i>Kenmichio</i> kept coming back to my mind. I knew that there was this substantial manuscript in my uncle&rsquo;s possession, but what might I be able to do with this artifact? My experience with digital imaging indicated that I could create a digital facsimile, producing a permanent copy of the original manuscript toward preservation of a physical document that was already over 80 years old. Further, encouraged by John Bryant&rsquo;s concept of the fluid text, &ldquo;any written work that exists in multiple material versions due to revisions (authorial, editorial, cultural) upon which we may construct an interpretation&rdquo; (Bryant 17), I began to visualize a readable digital text accounting for the many hand-written annotations Eddy included in the manuscript itself. These emendations are various, and range from simple spelling corrections, or the occationally added quotation mark forgotten in the typing, to much more substantial edits where the author might cross out large blocks of text to be removed or placed in other locations in the text. Sometimes, Eddy even makes wry remarks to himself regarding the text, at one part noting, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited. This is the first two sections. Still working on the last part.&rdquo; (<b>CITATION LINK</b>) So, embedded in the manuscript itself were at least two layers of text: the typed text of the novel proper and the handwritten annotations the author left for himself, or the text of the author trying to tell a story and his textual voice talking about the process of telling the story.
</p>
<p>
By the time I had acquired the manuscript of <i>Kenmichio</i> from my uncle, and had the chance to read the first half of the novel, I found that I had begun to compile a set of annotations of my own. Initially, I made notes on the nature and condition of the physical artifact; eventually, my notes turned to questions raised by the text and the mansucript, by the peculiarities of the language present in the novel, and by <i>Kenmichio</i>&rsquo;s relationship to other expressions of feminist utopia in literature. Finally, it became clear that the overall structure of this project would be a digital edition of <i>Kenmichio</i> that would include a digital facsimile (annotated to orient the reader to the manuscript as a physical object), a readable digital text taking into account all of the handwritten edits included by the author (also annotated in order to orient the reader to the nature of the novel&rsquo;s content and composition), as well as a literary introduction situating the novel within the context of feminist utopian literature. These initial ideas would eventually serve to influence the editorial rationale for this project, as well as the overall design of the website where it is housed. This website is the culmination of this trajectory, and these paragraphs sketch broadly where this novel came from, how I came to possess it, and what I would eventually do with it.
</p>
<p>
One question, however, I had not initially considered addressing with any detail was that of the author himself, Eugene Eddy. Even though Eddy is a relation, my great-uncle, and my possession of his manuscript is arguably in large part a result of this relationship, he was dead long before I came around. In fact, those members of my family who might have had the opportunity to know him didn&rsquo;t, and their memories of who he was vary greatly and are tinged by obscurity and legend.

        <h2>Editorial Rationale</h2>
        <p>
  The editorial rationale for the digital edition of <i>Kenmichio Goes Female</i> is guided by three goals: a) preservation of the original physical manuscript, b) the presentation of a digital readable text, and c) critical literary analysis of the content of the text, as well as the condition and nature of the physical manuscript. These three goal are reflected in the design of the website I have constructed for this project. &ldquo;The Manuscript&rdquo; page houses a collection of high-quality image scans of each page of the manuscript, thus preserving a digital copy of <i>Kenmichio Goes Female</i> that is a faithful facsimile of the physical manuscript. This section is also contains marginal annotations noting unique elements of the nature and condition of the physical manuscript. These annotations address characteristics such as the quality and condition of the paper Eddy typed the novel on, Eddy&rsquo;s unique and sometimes perplexing page numbering system, as well as a number of hand-written emendations added to the manuscript by the author. 
  </p>

  <p>
  &ldquo;The Text&rdquo; is a digital readable text edition of the novel that does not reflect any of the physical elements of the manuscript, but aims to reproduce the text itself in a readable form more suitable to digital environments. While the image scans accomplish an accurate preservation of the manuscript as a physical object, &ldquo;The Text&rdquo; aims to produce a text for reading. As such, this section of the digital edition takes into account much of the author&rsquo;s hand-written adjustments to the text. For example, with any hand-written spelling correction, the readable text edition preserves the corrected spelling, but makes no attempt to indicate that the physical page and the image scans of the page show that a change had been indicated by the author. This section is also marginally annotated, seeking to make comments upon unique characteristics of the text, in contrast to the annotations of the condition of the physical manuscript. The annotations in this section serve a further purpose. At the time that I took possession of <i>Kenmichio</i> and began the technical work of making digital images of each physical page, I had not yet read the novel in its entirety. So, when I pivoted toward processing the page images with OCR (optical character recognition) software, extracting plain text for the digital readable edition, I found myself enagaging in a new kind of critical reading for my first real encounter with <i>Kenmichio</i>. There was no opportunity for an initial leisurely read for pleasure or understanding, making notes of those lines that caught the eye of my readerly attention, which is my more usual first step when coming to a new text. Rather, my first comprehensive reading of the text came in the form of a line-by-line examination of the plain digital text, the primary goal of which was a check that the digital OCR text remained faithful to the original physical text. As such, my annotations of the text during this phase represent readerly observations on a very close scale. Rarely, in this process, was I able to read with the larger context of the novel fully in mind. As a result, the annotations keep a record of those inital telescopic observations of the text.
  </p>

  <p>
  In large part, the telescopic nature of the observational annotations in &ldquo;The Text&rdquo; would facilitate and necessitate a broader analysis of the novel as a whole. This end is the primary aim of the introductory materials, the editorial rationale, and the literary critique housed in the section of the website that you are now reading.
  </p>

  <p>
  The first phase of this project was the process of digitally scanning each page of Eddy&rsquo;s manuscript into high-quality digital images (in this case lossless TIFF image files). This initial set of image scans was saved both to a portable hard-drive as well as a cloud-based backup drive (GitHub), and serves as a permanent digital archive of <i>Kenmichio Goes Female</i>. These images would be further processed for use in &ldquo;The Manuscript&rdquo; page of the website. As they were, the original archive images were far too large for a website; the time required for any modern web browser to load those images would have been prohibitive to a functioning web experience. So, each image was compressed and exported as much smaller JPG format image files, while retaining much of the image quality. These compressed images adhere to best practices of image processing for web development and deployment.
  </p>

  <p>
  At the same time the images of each manuscript page were being produced, processed, and archived, I was thinking about the overall design of the website, as well as making my first attempts at a bare-bones landing page for the site. While the organizational structure was already coalescing around the three main components of the project&#x2026; MORE
