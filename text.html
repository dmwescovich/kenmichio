        <h2>Author's Preface</h2>
        <p>This story is all fiction; nothing -- no character, no name, no event, has been taken from life. I have no desire to change the political situation in our country; I have no objection to women being in political office.</p>
        <p>Eugene Eddy</p>
        <p>St. Louis, Mo.<br>May, 1934.</p>

        <h2>Chapter One: Entering Kenmichio</h2>
        <p>&ldquo;Yep, George! Ken City is next&#x2013;the Metropolis of Kenmichio! Home of the she-male politicians&#x2013;the women run it&#x2013;and how! No men allowed; woman governor! Women judges! Women police! Watch your step during your visit! Don&rsquo;t flirt! Better get one of those dog licenses!"</p>
        <p>The men uttering these words were momentarily clutching the top of the section of a Pullman car is a fast, lurching train. They recovered their equilibrium and went on their way laughingly and out of earshot of the brunette lady passenger near whose seat they had been forced to stop.</p>
        <p>The lady herself, who had thus unwittingly heard their remarks, was seated in Section 7 of car 304 which was a Pullman sleeper attached to a train enroute from New York to Chicago; the train, even then, was in the outskirts of Ken City, &ldquo;a city of over one million people&rdquo; as its Chamber of Commerce boastingly stated; it was about seven o&rsquo;clock of a fine May morning.</p>
        <p>The brunette lady in Section 7 might rate in her middle-thirties; she was attractive, with flashing, dark eyes, set off by a rich, creamy complexion; she appeared to be slender as she sat alternately gazing out of the window of the speeding car and then, covertly, watching the man across from her in Section 8.</p>
        <p>At that very moment she was thinking: &ldquo;If that big, handsome man intends to remain in Ken City he should at least be slightly interested in me&#x2013;for my position if nothing else! Even if I am twice divorced!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Again, she looked out of the window, reflecting:</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ouch! What a difficult man to become acquainted with! While this train goes on to Chicago, I know he is getting off at Ken City&#x2013;heard the porter mention it a few minutes ago&#x2013;wonder who he is?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Her cogitations about her fellow passenger were cut short by an abrupt movement of the man across the aisle. Something which had flashed by his window must have interested him, she decided.</p>
        <p>Of all the men in that train her eyes and her thoughts from the time they left New York the evening before to this moment had been centered upon the man across from her section. She had about made up her mind that he was between thirty-one and thirty-three. As the train had left its terminal the night before, she had instantly admired his alert, cultured face, his intelligent, assured look, his poise, his build; she had been wondering about his height; now in the morning sunlight she finally decided that he was more than six feet. His heavy brown hair and eagle brown eyes, surmounted by heavy eyebrows, set off his strong tan face. Had she been asked to describe the man by one word, she might have answered, &ldquo;Reserved.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Somewhat ruefully she recalled her attempts to make conversation with this fellow passenger between New York and Albany. She had commenced by offering him a New York evening paper. She remembered how formally, how very courteously, he had thanked her; stated he had read it. Chagrined, more at his manners than his statement, she had withdrawn within her shell. &ldquo;Why is it,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;that the men who make conversation easily with strange women, are so often the type a woman does not want to know?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Beyond Albany, she recalled, their eyes had met momentarily; she asked him to lend her a pencil, explaining with an alluring smile that she had lost a gold one; and she remembered well how the powerfully built tan-faced man had silently proffered a pencil with a bow and in due time how she had returned it, again attempting light conversation for which she received a slight smile, a smile with lips only and with a minimum of words.</p>
        <p>All of this passed through her mind this morning as she furtively studied her fellow passenger and the initials &ldquo;NW&rdquo; on his luggage and the paster<label for="sn-paster" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-paster" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Mis-spelling for poster or pasted?</span> &ldquo;Charing Cross&rdquo; on his expensive suitcase which stood in the aisle; she endeavored, not too openly, to decipher another sticker, partly obliterated, &ldquo;&#x2013;asa&rdquo; but gave it up.</p>
        <p>The porter came to &ldquo;NW,&rdquo; brushes and whist-broom in hand; the big man stepped lightly to the aisle and was brushed. The lady observed with approval his fine blue suit bespeaking expensive tailor artistry. His intelligent, assured face set off his well-knit figure; she had the impression that the man was in strange surroundings. Yet, she decided, he was not awkward, for all of his deep color, for his bulk, because no man on the Limited was more agile on his feet and there was a suppressed panther-like grace about his every movement.</p>
        <p>She wondered about the man; what made him different? He was certainly American; could it be the clothes? They seemed English; there was the &ldquo;Charing Cross&rdquo; label and that other, odd, partly obliterated sticker. She then decided that it must be the deep tan&#x2013;so rich that it might have been termed weather-beaten in an older or less attractive man&#x2013;which seemed to set him off from all of the usual run of soft, white-faced Americans.<label for="sn-white-faced-americans" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-white-faced-americans" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This description establishes caucasian as the default American, and suggests that the novel will adhere to discriminatory assumptions regarding race and gender.</span></p>
        <p>The object of her curiosity extended a dark hand to the porter. The porter glanced speculatively at the green picture of Father George and tentatively hinted at change, making suggestive motions of diving into his pocket for silver, yet, expertly failing to emerge with it, but salaamed with a, &ldquo;Thank you, sir&#x2013;thank you, sir!&rdquo; accomplanied with an unctious and rising inflection on the repetition and a grin from ear to ear upon being informed by the tan-faced man that the entire amount was conveyed by the deed of transfer.</p>
        <p>As the Limited reached the thickly settled parts of Ken City, Mr. &ldquo;NW&rdquo; threw back his broad shoulders and exhibited manifest interest, in fact as his silent observer pondered, the only interest he had shown in anything since leaving New York the night before.</p>
        <p>But perhaps we can leave this twice divorced, long, slender, vivacious, dark-eyed lady and her &ldquo;for-my-position-if-nothing-else&rdquo;&#x2013;she&rsquo;s only a woman anyhow!<label for="sn-who-is-we" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-who-is-we" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This is the first suggestion of a self-conscious narrator.</span></p>
        <p>&ldquo;NW&rdquo; ran a competant hand through his thick brown hair observing with interest the entrance of the train into a subway; a distance of perhaps one mile was traversed and then the train rolled majestically into a magnificent station.</p>
        <p>By that time the passengers were forming a line in the aisle.</p>
        <p>The towering, tan-faced man scarcely noted the attractive brunette as she skillfully maneuvered a place just ahead of him; all unaware was he of her curiosity about him; he did not observe that the dark-eyed lady, when she reached the platform, was greeted and kissed effusively by a man and a woman and greeted as &ldquo;Gen.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Our man<label for="sn-our-man" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-our-man" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Another expression of the self-conscious narrator.</span> surrendered willingly to an eager redcap; he identified his baggage and followed his porter and the other passengers along the platform.</p>
        <p>At the iron gate a woman in a uniform handed him a small booklet, with a courteous, &ldquo;Police regulations, sir!&rdquo; He took it, bowed and followed his redcap to the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>He came out into a vista of modernity; a wide thoroughfare of concrete was before him; numerous automobiles darted by. He almost rubbed his eyes; he was aghast at the vast concourse, strange buildings, stretching away in the distance. Was this his home town? Mechanically, as if in a dream, he was aware of the porter placing his luggage within the taxi and that he tipped him.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Where to, sir?&rdquo; he was reminded by an alert cabbie.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;NW&rdquo; turned to regard him. A trim girl of twenty-two<label for="sn-twenty-two" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-twenty-two" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Eddy's default descriptors tend toward age, weight, and height. A weird conceptual tic? On one hand, this suggests that his characters exist in a space where statistical demographics are the baseline when it comes to identifiable marks of human characters. It seems like these descriptions are stuck somehow on the shallow surface of what a person really is. On the other hand, this might also suggest some kind of development of the feminine wherein the beginning of the novel is hyper-attuned to the shallow marks of the demographic, the physical measurements of a woman that will soon be challenged culturally and conceptually as NW learns more about the nature of Kenmichio.</span> met his gaze. Perplexed, he noticed other cabs, automobiles darting by&#x2013;many driven by women. He seemed lost.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Cab&#x2013;pardon&#x2013;Miss&#x2013;but what street is this?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;29th Street, sir,&rdquo; she answered with a smile. As he appeared at a loss, she went on, &ldquo;It is the West Side of town, sir, although close to the center part.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Hat in hand he stared in perplexity.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Miss, pardon me, I hope you&rsquo;ll not mind the delay, I have been away from here a long time&#x2013;seven years. That wide street or boulevard there, ahead of us&#x2013;what is that?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Annabelle Parkway, sir.&rdquo; To his next question, she replied, &ldquo;It extends beyond the city limits, to 105th, sir.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Paper, sir!&rdquo; came an interruption from a newsgirl, age about seventeen.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, regarding her with frankly curious brown eyes. &ldquo;Give me the&#x2026;,&rdquo; he searched his memory, recalling the <i>Ken City Gazette</i>, was attempting to think of&#x2026;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;<i>Gazette</i> or <i>Freeman</i>, sir?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Both.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Papers in hand, he still remained on the curb.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;1776, sir?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The returned stranger stared at the cab-girl, mystification in his intelligent face. &ldquo;Beg pardon.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hotel 1776, sir?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is that the name of a hotel?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&#x2013;the best one for men.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He stepped into the taxi. &ldquo;Cabby&#x2013;take me to the old Excelsior House&#x2013;if it&rsquo;s not pulled down&#x2013;Do you know where it is?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she replied, as she sped away.</p>
        <p>He attempted to orient himself and it was not until they reached Arokla Street that he recognized a landmark; it seemed like an old friend. He leaned forward.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Arokla Street seems to have been widened, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&#x2013;Arokla Boulevard now.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And what are those two handsome buildings&#x2013;hotels?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, the one to the right is the Anthony Hotel, and the one to the left is the Hotel Mary, sir.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Speeding along Arokla Boulevard, he was impressed with the air of cleanliness, spruceness, prosperity, heavy traffic. Substantial buildings, business places, lined both sides of the boulevard. He recalled clearly that seven years before, Arokla Street in that vicinity had been principally old-fashioned mansions of by-gone days, down at heels. Just then he spied a policeman&#x2013;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, by St. Judas! A woman!&rdquo; He turned to observe her. As he resumed his position he thought he detected a smile upon the face of his jehu.</p>
        <p>Another block and he interrupted again:</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Pardon, cabby&#x2013;but where is the street railway?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Taken up last year, sir&#x2013;six track subway under this street.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He observed women driving trucks, women driving other cabs and motor-buses, women driving private cars, some in livery. A blockade in traffic gave him an opportunity to observe the neat blue street signs, giving the name of streets in each direction, and the equivalent number of the nearest house in each direction!</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Have all the street names been changed, cabby?</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, with a very few exceptions&#x2013;about four years ago. All streets running from east to west are numbered consecutively from one up, beginning at the river; they are called streets, All the streets running from north to south are numbered from one beginning at the eastern city limits; they are called avenues.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Helplessly, he held his peace, vaguely noticing many large new office buildings which he did not place. Then, as he watched, they came to a small street, bisecting the boulevard, almost an alley; yet teaming with business. Yes, there it was, a neat sign: &ldquo;Waldis St.&rdquo; called after his great-great-grandfather&#x2013;a pioneer of this new strange Ken City&#x2013;and still carrying the old name!</p>
        <p>The taxi passed the old city hall, his heart warming to it. They shot across what he had known as Main Street after receiving permission from a traffic officer in a tower&#x2013;whose face seemed that of a woman! The sight of the old Excelsior House warmed the cockles of his heart; it was something to tie to the past. At the hotel he paid off his cab and was taken charge of by a porter.</p>

        <h2>Chapter Two: The Man From Africa</h2>
        <p>At the desk the traveller wrote firmly, easily, boldly with his powerful right hand, meticulously manicured:</p>
        <blockquote><p>NORMAN WALDIS, MOMBASA.</p></blockquote>
        <p>The elderly mail clerk, scanned the signature and the &ldquo;Mombasa&rdquo; and glanced at Waldis courteously, with a second surreptitious glance at the guest&rsquo;s capable hands, at his easy grace.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Long time since I have seen or heard of that name, sir. Wonder, if by chance, you are any relation to the judge&#x2013;Judge Waldis&#x2013;who died here in Ken City some years back?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; the guest answered. Noting friendly interest in the greeter&rsquo;s eyes, he added: &ldquo;I have been away for seven years.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Been far, sir?&rdquo; the clerk inquired, his eyes again on &ldquo;Mombasa&rdquo; on the registration card.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Africa principally.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>In an old-fashioned high-ceilinged but cheerful room, Waldis bathed and changed. He had breakfasted on the train. For a moment he stood at a window and looked upon his native city, the he noticed the newpapers in his light overcoat pocket. He pulled them forth, and as he did, the small police booklet handed him at the train gate, fell to the floor. He picked it up, opened and glanced at the first page:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>TO ALL MALE PERSONS OVER TWENTY!<br>The law of Kenmichio requires that all male persons who have passed their twentieth birthday and who intend to remain in the state more than Five (5) days must have a personal license.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Waldis ran his eyes down the page and succeeding pages, observing that travellers intending to be in the state a brief period had a form of temporary license, while those intending to remain in Kenmichio had a permanent type. Directions were given for securing the license from the proper law officers. Those in doubt were directed to ask the nearest peace-officer.</p>
        <p>Suddenly he remembered his aunt.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Fine nephew I turned out to be,&rdquo; he muttered with a grin, reaching for a telephone book. He paged the Bs: &ldquo;Bender&#x2013;Benker&#x2013;Benson&#x2013;ha! Here it is: Bentham, Mrs. Hannah, 4610 53rd Avenue&#x2013;Wonder where that is? Phone: Mary 3457&#x2013;everything &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; in the old home town! Well here goes for a fine bawling out&#x2013;hope auntie doesn&rsquo;t drop dead from shock!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>While awaiting the connection he ruminated upon his absence from Kenmichio; the few letters he had written his aunt began to loom as insignificant. He had cabled her from Mombasa that he was starting home by slow stages&#x2013;that he was many weeks back&#x2013;he had thought of cabling from London, had not done so; nor had he wired or written from New York.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he heard.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Are you Mrs. Hannie Benthan, please?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&#x2013;who?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hannie, old girl&#x2013;how are you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Normie!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;You villain! When did you arrive? You mean boy&#x2013;why did you not wire ahead? Oh, Normie&#x2013;I&rsquo;m so glad&#x2013;and where are you now?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Excelsior House, Aunt Hannie. Are you going to be at home all forenoon&#x2013;I&rsquo;ll&#x2013;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Normie&#x2013;oh, do come out at once; I&rsquo;ll be waiting, so impatiently. Please hurry.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Auntie, I&rsquo;ll start at once. Remember now, no special preparations&#x2013;I&rsquo;ve had breakfast&#x2014;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Never mind the orders, Norm&#x2013;you come out at once!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Waldis telephoned the desk and ordered a taxi, gave a last look at himself in the mirror and descended. At the curb he found another trim young woman in the driver&rsquo;s seat of the taxi. Hand on the door, he directed pleasantly: &ldquo;Drive to the nest candy store in town, please.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The taxi threaded its way up Arokla and stopped at a store near 10th Street. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; announced the taxi-girl.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Wait, please,&rdquo; he directed. Ten minutes later he came out with a large box. &ldquo;Now, young lady&#x2013;the leading florist.&rdquo; The taxi-girl smiled her understanding and very soon he was in possession of an immense box of American Beauty roses.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Taxi&#x2013;drive to 4610 53rd Avenue&#x2013;near the corner of 46th Street and 53rd Avenue, I have reason to believe.&rdquo; He had written the directions from his aunt&rsquo;s telephone instructions. &ldquo;Take a short route, please&#x2013;but if possible, follow some one of the new boulevards. Go via that&#x2013;what is it? Ah-Annette Parkway?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Annabelle Parkway, sir&#x2013;called after out mayor, Annabelle Fremly, sir&#x2013;we will turn on to that at 29th Street&#x2013;and use that as far as Mary Cort Boulevard, sir.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Did you say Mary Cort?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir &#x2013; Mary Cort Boulevard.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>As the taxi turned at 59th and Arokla, he observed again the two handsome hotels. Seven blocks west he saw the great K. &amp; K. Railway Terminal from whence he had alighted but a short time before, then the taxi swerved into the vast thoroughfare at which he had exclaimed earlier&#x2013;he caught himself estimating if he had ever beheld a wider street in his travels! As the taxi sped on he observed the handsome homes, neat, comfortable, each with a spacious plot of ground to itself. After about a mile the car turned into another wide boulevard&#x2013;he caught the street sign: &ldquo;Mary Cort Bd.&rdquo; The taxi traversed Mary Cort Boulevard for a short distance and he noted with ever growing amusement the comfortable home life, urban life, in a district which he now began to recall had been truck farms seven years before!</p>
        <p>The taxi turned again&#x2013;to the right&#x2013;a street sign read: &ldquo;53rd Av.&rdquo; After one more block the taxi pulled to the curb.</p>
        <p>Waldis checked the house number: &ldquo;4610.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Even as the taxi departed, the door of the neat bungalow numbered &ldquo;4610&rdquo; opened and a small woman of possibly fifty-five came out to the porch. A smile of joy permeated her face. Yet, whatever she had intended to say was checked; her smile changed to a look of bewilderment; she stood speechless.</p>
        <p>Waldis stood at the foot of the steps, looking up at her, grinning silently, then he took the four steps with one bound.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Aunt Hannie!&rdquo; he chuckled softly.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hannah Benthan gasped&rdquo; &ldquo;Normie&#x2013;can it be you?&rdquo; Her arms opened only to be folded within the powerful young giant&rsquo;s arms during which he lifted her lightly from her feet. For the next few moments emotion overpowered them and they were somewhat incoherent. Then she cried: &ldquo;Normie! You big bear&#x2013;set me down!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He complied, chuckling. Mrs. Bentham brushed away a tear. She stepped back to appraise her nephew.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, Norm&#x2013;how you have changed! You must weigh two hundred!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;One hundred ninety even, Aunty,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But come into the house, Normie&#x2013;you look wonderful&#x2013;and how tanned. And what hands! What did you weigh when you left here?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, Auntie, possibly about a hundred forty,&rdquo; and then he handed her the flowers and candy receiving more hugs and kisses and a bombardment of incoherent questions. He did his best to answer her.</p>
        <p>At last she broke in: &ldquo;And you poor boy, how long were you a prisoner with those horrible cannibals?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t cannibals, Aunt, just savages. I was their prisoner six months&#x2013;that&rsquo;s five years ago.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Six months a prisoner with savages? You must be starved; I&rsquo;ll order something to eat!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But, Auntie, I ate on the train; I&rsquo;m not starved. And I have baggage at the Excelsior House.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll have it brought here at once. I live here alone with one servant&#x2013;you are my only near relative&#x2013;shame on you not to write more.&rdquo; Waldis expressed penitence. Hannah Bentham went on, &ldquo;You will live here&#x2013;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Auntie, but I won&rsquo;t sponge on you&#x2013;I have three trunks in the baggage room.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Send them here, Norm. you will have a nice room&#x2013;after seven years globe-trotting, mine-digging, savage-fighting&#x2013;you ought to settle down, live a respectable life. I am fifty-seven, Norm, and lonely. I&rsquo;m so happy to have you home.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Auntie, I&rsquo;m  grateful for this wonderful reception, yet, after making a fool of myself in that mining scheme in Africa and losing the little fortune father left me and now coming back with a pittance I don&rsquo;t propose to live on you. Intend to get out and hustle. Since you have welcomed me so kind,&rdquo; he hesitated a moment, then resumed, &ldquo;I will visit with you a few days until I get my bearings.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Normie, we won&rsquo;t argue it now. Luncheon will be soon. Then after luncheon go to your hotel, move your bags, trunks here. And did you lose all your money in that mine?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Every cent, Auntie, also the money I secured by mortgaging the family homestead on Birren Street&#x2013;well, the good old house is gone!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t! I bought the mortgage. When it came due and nothing was heard from you, my lawyer advised me to foreclose and take title&#x2013;but, Norm, it&rsquo;s yours&#x2013;I&rsquo;ll deed it back.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Aunt Hannie, why?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You are my heir, anyhow, my will leaves everything to you&#x2013;so I might as well.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Aunt, pardone me. I couldn&rsquo;t think of accepting it. Let things as they are; a monument to my youthful folly.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Youthful folly? Do you think you are old at thirty?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Aunt, twenty-three to thirty, while but seven years, has made a change in me I hope. I would be hopeless were it otherwise. I do not return penniless. When I left Mombasa, about three and a half months ago, I had the equivalent of about $3500 in American money. I spent about $1000 since then. So I have about $2500 and my two hands.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Hannah Bentham gazed upon the aforesaid hands.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Judging by the two hands, Norm, you won&rsquo;t starve. But all this is but a detail. You won&rsquo;t have to worry. I&rsquo;ll be glad to have you with me&#x2013;I have enough for two. I am renting your old home to a good tenant; then I own this bungalow and in addition two flat buildings, all free and clear of mortgages.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Fine, Auntie,&rdquo; Norman said with a grin. &ldquo;Glad to learn that you are such a shrewd financier, that at least one Waldis knows how to hold on to money; I fear that I may never learn it. Yet, I intend to earn my keep. By the way,&rdquo; he rose to his towering height and stood before some large framed oil paintings. &ldquo;Aunt, I see the ancestors&rsquo; pictures. There&rsquo;s grandfather Elisha Waldis in the rig of fifty years ago&#x2013;and father&#x2013;and&#x2013;&rdquo; he paused in silence.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Norm, there&rsquo;s your mother,&rdquo; and as they stood before the painting of Waldis&rsquo; mother, the mother who had died in his infancy, leaving him to a heart-broken father, whose picture he next observed. Hannah Bentham went on, &ldquo;And, Norm, you&rsquo;,l be glad. I had all your books, histories, lawbooks, everything boxed up&#x2013;they&rsquo;re in my basement&#x2013;are you still such a student?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, Aunt, I suppose, but for seven years the problem of life itself has been so immediate, haven&rsquo;t had time&#x2013;speaking of life and earning a living&#x2013;you know I was admitted to the bar as a lawyer in Kenmichio, with only a year and a half of practice, before I went to Africa&#x2013;what is this about women running Kenmichio? And who is Mary Cort?&rdquo;</p>
